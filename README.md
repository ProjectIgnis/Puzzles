# Project Ignis canonical puzzle collection for EDOPro

Pull requests are welcome for new additions and fixes.
Note that existing inherited puzzles might not be up to par with these standards.

* Puzzles must be solvable, except maybe tutorials.
* Puzzles should go in an existing folder. Custom puzzles belong under Miscellaneous.
* Puzzle names should not contain special characters and underscores are preferred to spaces.
* Creators may include their names in the puzzle name, in which case the puzzles should be numbered.
* Solutions should be in a second comment in the puzzle, attached to the pull request, or sent to gidoen_g2 on discord via replay form.
* In puzzle code, prefer tabs for indentation.
